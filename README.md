# The Truth is Out There
Creating a web repository for UFO sightings.
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive webpage to house UFO sighting data. The page allows users to filter data by five different parameters.

## Results
 
### Upon loading the web page the user is presented with an article introducing the subject of UFO sightings.

### There are five filters to allow users to narrow down the data set to specific dates. cities, states, countries or shapes.

## Summary
The app is limited in its ability to present filtered data. A user must have some idea of the areas that have recorded sightings. It would be more helpful if the code were updated to allow for sightings within a given region or radius. The code should also be updated to allow for any case, instead of having to match the case of the filtered parameter exactly.
